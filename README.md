# SimpleShell

This is a simple Shell system that includes a security system, file system consisting of a logical, virtual, and physical system. 
The shell hosts a session for a user within the terminal which allows for the user to execute some native commands such as cd, pwd, ls, and more.
This repository is based on a project done in collaboration with a Operating Systems class as the final project.
